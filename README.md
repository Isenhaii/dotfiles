## Package installs

- `dnsutils` (to get `dig`) 
- `nmap`
- `anaconda` OR `miniconda`
- pick something fun:
     -cmatrix

In your script:

1. Check if running as `root`
2. Check for `apt` package manager
3. Install things above
4. Determine how to run remainder of taskings as non-root so that the right ownership is applied
